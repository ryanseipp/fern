## Report a security issue

This project welcomes security reports and is committed to providing prompt
attention to security issues. Security issues should be reported via the
[GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/ryanseipp/fern/security) feature.
Please reference the
[GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/about-coordinated-disclosure-of-security-vulnerabilities)
for more information about how to disclose a security issue using the feature.
Security issues should **not** be reported via the public GitHub Issue tracker.

## Vulnerability coordination

Remediation of security vulnerabilities will be prioritized, and coordinated
with third-party stakeholders via
[GitHub Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories).
Third-party stakeholders may include the reporter of the issue, affected direct
or indirect users of this project, and maintainers of upstream dependencies if
applicable.

Downstream project maintainers and users can request participation in
coordination of applicable security issues by sending your contact email
address, GitHub username(s) and any other relevant information to
security@ryanseipp.com. Participation in the security issue coordination process
is at the discretion of project maintainers.

## Security advisories

The project team is committed to transparency in the security issue disclosure
process. Security issues will be announced via
[project GitHub Release notes](https://github.com/ryanseipp/fern/releases) and
the [RustSec advisory database](https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db) (i.e.
`cargo-audit`).
